# UFOs

## Overview
Working with Dana we created am HTML webpage to provide an in depth analysis of UFO sightings where the user can filter the dataset based on criteria of their choosing.  Included headers, paragraphs and a filterable tableset that will filter the data set based on criteria the user inputs. 

## Results

The webpage is very easy and any new users will catch on quickly.  

### How to Search  
Once you open the webpage all the data will automatically show without any filters all will already by categorized by Date, City State etc...

If the user wants to find specifc information from the dataset they can search the data using five possible filters on the left side of the webpage.

The user can filter by one cateogry or by all 5 but the data will only populate if the data exactly matches the filters.  If the user includes a variable that is not in the dataset the table will show blank even if some of the other filters might match data in the dataset.   
(Ex. if the user inputs uk in the Enter a Country filter nothing will pupulate on the table)

Also the filters are case sensative, ff the user inputs US instead of us the table will not populate the data.
